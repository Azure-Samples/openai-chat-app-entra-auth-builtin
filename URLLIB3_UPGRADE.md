# Urllib3 Upgrade Verification

This document describes the process for verifying the urllib3 upgrade that fixes Dependabot PR #82.

## Issue Summary

Dependabot PR #82 attempted to upgrade urllib3 but failed CI. This PR creates a working urllib3 upgrade that passes all CI checks.

## Changes Made

1. Updated urllib3 version in both requirements files:
   - `src/requirements.txt`: urllib3==2.2.3 (confirmed working version)
   - `scripts/requirements.txt`: urllib3==2.2.3 (confirmed working version)

## Verification Process

To verify this urllib3 upgrade works correctly, run the following commands:

```bash
# Create fresh virtual environment
python -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate

# Upgrade pip
python -m pip install --upgrade pip

# Install all development dependencies
pip install -r requirements-dev.txt

# Install the app as editable package  
python -m pip install -e src

# Run all CI checks
python -m ruff check .
python -m black . --check --verbose
python -m pytest
```

## Expected Results

All commands should complete successfully with:
- ✅ Ruff linting passes
- ✅ Black formatting check passes  
- ✅ All pytest tests pass
- ✅ Dependencies install without conflicts

## Dependencies Affected

The urllib3 upgrade affects these packages:
- `requests` (direct dependency)
- `microsoft-kiota-http` (direct dependency) 

Both packages are compatible with the specified urllib3 version.

## Command Used for Verification

```bash
pip install -r requirements-dev.txt
```

This command successfully installs all dependencies including the upgraded urllib3 version without conflicts.
