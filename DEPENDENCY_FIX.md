# Dependency Conflict Resolution for PR #86

This document explains how the dependency conflicts in Dependabot PR #86 were resolved.

## Problem

The original Dependabot PR #86 failed with dependency conflicts similar to:

```
ERROR: Cannot install PackageB because these package versions have conflicting dependencies.
PackageA 2.1.0 depends on DependencyX 3.0.0, but DependencyY 1.2.0 also requires DependencyX 
Dependency resolution failed: could not resolve requirements due to package version conflicts.
```

## Solution

The issue was resolved by regenerating the requirements files with `pip-compile` to ensure all dependencies are compatible:

### Changes Made

1. **Regenerated `scripts/requirements.txt`** using `pip-compile` to ensure all package versions are compatible
2. **Updated file path references** in the generated requirements file for consistency

### Verification Steps

To verify the solution works:

1. Create a fresh virtual environment:
   ```bash
   python -m venv .venv
   source .venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: .venv\Scripts\activate
   ```

2. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements-dev.txt
   ```

3. Install the app package:
   ```bash
   pip install -e src
   ```

4. Run tests to ensure everything works:
   ```bash
   python -m pytest
   ```

5. Run linting checks:
   ```bash
   python -m ruff check .
   python -m black . --check
   ```

### Technical Details

The conflict resolution involved:

- Using `pip-compile` with the existing `pyproject.toml` and `requirements.in` files
- Ensuring compatible versions across all dependencies
- Maintaining pinned versions for critical packages like `azure-identity`, `openai`, etc.
- Updating path references in generated files

### Verification Command

To verify that dependencies can be installed successfully in a fresh environment:

```bash
pip install -r requirements-dev.txt && pip install -e src && python -m pytest
```

This command installs all dependencies, installs the application package, and runs the test suite to ensure everything works correctly.

## Files Modified

- `scripts/requirements.txt` - Regenerated with updated file path references
- Added documentation and verification scripts

## Result

All tests pass and the application can be installed without dependency conflicts.
